<p>Assume a LOW logic level is placed on the SHIFT/LOAD input of a 74195 shift register. The output will change ________.</p>,immediately,if the CLOCK is also LOW,on the next clock leading edge,depending on the J and K inputs,,C,
"<p>A type of shift register in which the Q or <span style=""text-decoration:overline"">Q</span> output of one stage is not connected to the input of the next stage is ________.</p>",parallel in/serial out,serial in/parallel out,serial in/serial out,parallel in/parallel out,,D,
"<p>A Johnson counter, constructed with N flip-flops, has how many unique states?</p>",N,2N,2<sup>N</sup>,N<sup>2</sup>,,B,
<p>A type of shift register that requires access to the Q outputs of all stages is ________.</p>,parallel in/serial out,serial in/parallel out,serial in/serial out,a bidirectional shift register,,B,
"<p>An 8-bit serial in/parallel out shift register is clocked at 4 MHz and is used to delay a serial digital signal by 1.25 <img src=""/_files/images/digital-electronics/digital-fundamentals/mu.gif""/>s. The output that has the proper delay is ________.</p>",Q<sub>E</sub>,Q<sub>F</sub>,Q<sub>G</sub>,Q<sub>H</sub>,,A,
<p>A 4-bit ring counter is loaded with a single 1. The frequency of any given output is ________.</p>,the same as the clock,twice the clock frequency,one-half the clock frequency,one-fourth the clock frequency,,D,
<p>Shifting a binary number to the left by one position is equivalent to ________.</p>,multiplying by two,multiplying by four,dividing by two,dividing by four,,A, Shifting a binary number by one bit is equivalent to multiplying (when shifting to the left) or dividing (when shifting to the right) the number by 2. 
<p>Assume a 4-bit Johnson counter is initially cleared. After the first clock pulse the output is 0001. After the next clock pulse the output will be ________.</p>,0011,0010,1000,0110,,A,
<p>Assume a 4-bit parallel in/serial out shift register is loaded with a binary number. How many clock pulses are required after the parallel load has occurred before the first bit in the sequence appears on the serial output line?</p>,0,1,2,3,,B,
<p>Assume an 8-bit serial in/parallel out shift register needs to be cleared but has no clear input. How many clock cycles are required before a zero applied to the input appears on the Q<sub>H</sub> output?</p>,1,7,8,9,,C,

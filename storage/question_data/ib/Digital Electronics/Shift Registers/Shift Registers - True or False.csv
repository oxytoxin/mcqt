question,A,B,C,D,E,answer,explanation
<p>One of the stages in a register consists of a latch.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
"<p>There are several ways to construct a stepper motor to achieve digitally controlled stepping action. One possibility is to construct four stator coils set up as four pole pairs, each 45° apart and using three ferromagnetic pairs spaced 60° apart.</p>",True,False,,,,A,
"<p>A parallel load operation is asynchronous, so it is not dependent on the clock.</p>",True,False,,,,A,
<p>A ferromagnetic material is one that forms a resistance to magnetic fields.</p>,True,False,,,,B,
"<p>A counter has a specified sequence of states, but a shift register does not.</p>",True,False,,,,A,
"<p>In a 74164 8-bit shift register, in order for the parallel data output to be synchronously loaded on the negative clock edge, the parallel enable input is LOW.</p>",True,False,,,,B,
"<p>Practically every possible load, shift, and conversion operation is available in a shift register IC.</p>",True,False,,,,A,
<p>Using separate serial inputs for shifting left or shifting right is a major difference between the 74194 and other shift registers.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
<p>Parallel load means to load all flip-flops at the same time.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
<p>The ring and Johnson shift counters are uncommon circuits that are similar to synchronous counters.</p>,True,False,,,,B,
<p>A stepper motor makes its rotation in smooth continuous motion.</p>,True,False,,,,B,
<p>A universal shift register has both serial and parallel input and output capacity.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
<p>The storage capacity of a register makes it an important type of memory.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
<p>The 74194 4-bit bidirectional universal shift register has a wide range of applications.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
"<p>To transmit parallel data over a serial cable, the data must first go through data conversion to the serial format.</p>",True,False,,,,A,
<p>A ring counter is a register in which a certain pattern of 1s and 0s is continuously outputted in parallel.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
<p>Bidirectional means having two states.</p>,True,False,,,,B,
<p>Eight states are in an 8-bit Johnson counter sequence.</p>,True,False,,,,B,
<p>A stage is two storage elements in a register.</p>,True,False,,,,B,
"<p>When <img src=""/_files/images/digital-electronics/digital-fundamentals/tfq9_00300.gif""/> is LOW, the data are shifted one bit per clock pulse.</p>",True,False,,,,B,

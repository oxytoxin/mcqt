question,A,B,C,D,E,answer,explanation
<p>Select the statement that best describes the parity method of error detection:</p>,Parity checking is best suited for detecting double-bit errors that occur during the transmission of codes from one location to another.,Parity checking is not suitable for detecting single-bit errors in transmitted codes.,Parity checking is best suited for detecting single-bit errors in transmitted codes.,Parity checking is capable of detecting and correcting errors in transmitted codes.,,C,
<p>A logic circuit that provides a HIGH output for both inputs HIGH or both inputs LOW is a(n):</p>,Ex-NOR gate,OR gate,Ex-OR gate,NAND gate,,A,
"<p>A logic circuit that provides a HIGH output if one input or the other input, but not both, is HIGH, is a(n):</p>",Ex-NOR gate,OR gate,Ex-OR gate,NAND gate,,C,
"<p>Identify the type of gate below from the equation <img src=""/_files/images/digital-electronics/basic-digital-electronics/mcq6_1002_1.gif""/></p>",Ex-NOR gate,OR gate,Ex-OR gate,NAND gate,,C,
<p>How is odd parity generated differently from even parity?</p>,The first output is inverted.,The last output is inverted.,,,,B,
<p>Parity systems are defined as either________ or ________ and will add an extra ________ to the digital information being transmitted.</p>,"positive, negative, byte","odd, even, bit","upper, lower, digit","on, off, decimal",,B,
<p>Which type of gate can be used to add two bits?</p>,Ex-OR,Ex-NOR,Ex-NAND,NOR,,A,
<p>Why is an exclusive-NOR gate also called an equality gate?</p>,The output is false if the inputs are equal.,The output is true if the inputs are opposite.,The output is true if the inputs are equal.,,,C,
<p>Show from the truth table how an exclusive-OR gate can be used to invert the data on one input if the other input is a special control function.</p>,"Using <i>A</i> as the control, when <i>A</i> = 0, <i>X</i> is the same as <i>B</i>. When <i>A</i> = 1, <i>X</i> is the same as <i>B</i>.","Using <i>A</i> as the control, when <i>A</i> = 0, <i>X</i> is the same as <i>B</i>. When <i>A</i> = 1, <i>X</i> is the inverse of <i>B</i>.","Using <i>A</i> as the control, when <i>A</i> = 0, <i>X</i> is the inverse of <i>B</i>. When <i>A</i> = 1, <i>X</i> is the same as <i>B</i>.","Using <i>A</i> as the control, when <i>A</i> = 0, <i>X</i> is the inverse of <i>B</i>. When <i>A</i> = 1, <i>X</i> is the inverse of <i>B</i>.",,B,
<p>Determine odd parity for each of the following data words:<br/> 1011101        11110111        1001101</p>,"<i>P</i> = 1, <i>P</i> = 1, <i>P</i> = 0","<i>P</i> = 0, <i>P</i> = 0, <i>P</i> = 0","<i>P</i> = 1, <i>P</i> = 1, <i>P</i> = 1","<i>P</i> = 0, <i>P</i> = 0, <i>P</i> = 1",,D,
<p>The Ex-NOR is sometimes called the ________.</p>,parity gate,equality gate,inverted OR,parity gate or the equality gate,,B,

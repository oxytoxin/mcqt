"<p>Using the CPLD design environment, we can simulate any combinations of inputs and observe the resulting output to check for proper circuit operation.</p>",True,False,,,,A,
<p>The exclusive-OR provides a LOW input if one input or the other input is HIGH.</p>,True,False,,,,B,
<p>The exclusive-OR is written in a Boolean equation as a plus sign with a circle around it.</p>,True,False,,,,A,

<p>The Ex-NOR is sometimes called the equality gate.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
"<p>A parity checker is constructed in the same way as a parity generator, except that in a 4-bit system there must be five inputs, and the output is used as the error indicator.</p>",True,False,,,,A,

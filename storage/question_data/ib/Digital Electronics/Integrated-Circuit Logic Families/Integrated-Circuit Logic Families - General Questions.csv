<p>Which of the following logic families has the highest maximum clock frequency?</p>,S-TTL,AS-TTL,HS-TTL,HCMOS,,B,
<p>Why is the fan-out of CMOS gates frequency dependent?</p>,Each CMOS input gate has a specific propagation time and this limits the number of different gates that can be connected to the output of a CMOS gate.,"When the frequency reaches the critical value, the gate will only be capable of delivering 70% of the normal output voltage and consequently the output power will be one-half of normal; this defines the upper operating frequency.","The higher the number of gates attached to the output, the more frequently they will have to be serviced, thus reducing the frequency at which each will be serviced with an input signal.","The input gates of the FETs are predominantly capacitive, and as the signal frequency increases the capacitive loading also increases, thereby limiting the number of loads that may be attached to the output of the driving gate.",,D,

<p>What must be done to interface TTL to CMOS?</p>,A dropping resistor must be used on the CMOS 12 V supply to reduce it to 5 V for the TTL.,"As long as the CMOS supply voltage is 5 V, they can be interfaced; however, the fan-out of the TTL is limited to five CMOS gates.",A 5 V Zener diode must be placed across the inputs of the TTL gates in order to protect them from the higher output voltages of the CMOS gates.,A pull-up resistor must be used between the TTL output-CMOS input node and <i>V</i><sub>cc</sub>; the value of RP will depend on the number of CMOS gates connected to the node.,,D,

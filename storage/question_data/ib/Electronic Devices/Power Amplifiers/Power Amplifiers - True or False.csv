<p>Class AB operation always requires a dual (+/–) supply.</p>,True,False,,,,B,
<p>Class A amplifiers operate in the active region of the load line all of the time.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
<p>The efficiency of any amplifier is the ratio of signal output power to signal input power.</p>,True,False,,,,B,
<p>A class A amplifier conducts 180° of the cycle.</p>,True,False,,,,B,
<p>The class C amplifier is biased below cutoff.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
<p>Class B amplifiers are usually zero-biased.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
<p>Class B amplifiers are usually operated in push-pull to obtain an output that is a near replica of the input signal.</p>,True,False,,,,A,

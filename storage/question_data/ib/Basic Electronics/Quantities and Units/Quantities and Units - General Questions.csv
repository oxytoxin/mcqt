question,A,B,C,D,E,answer,explanation
<p>Derived units are obtained from various combinations of</p>,electrical quantities,fundamental units,metric prefixes,international standards,,B,
<p>Which of the following metric prefixes could replace 10<sup>–9</sup>?</p>,Nano,Mega,Kilo,Micro,,A,
<p>Scientific notation is a method</p>,of expressing a very large number,of expressing a very small number,used to make calculations with large and small numbers,All of the above,,D,
"<p>If you drop a 5 when rounding a number, you are using the</p>",round-to-even rule,significant digit rule,round-off rule,retained digit rule,,A,
<p>7200 mV is the same as</p>,"7.2 <img align=""absmiddle"" alt=""mu.gif"" src=""/_files/images/basic-electronics/basics/mu.gif""/>V",7.2 V,"7,200,000 V","0.0072 <img align=""absmiddle"" alt=""mu.gif"" src=""/_files/images/basic-electronics/basics/mu.gif""/>V",,B,
<p>A measure of the repeatability of a measurement of some quantity is</p>,error,precision,accuracy,significant,,B,
"<p>Another name for ""fundamental units"" is</p>",base units,atoms,the metric system,letter symbols,,A,
<p>Adding 27.5 × 10<sup>3</sup> to 8.9 × 10<sup>4</sup> equals</p>,36.4 × 10<sup>7</sup>,116.5 × 10<sup>4</sup>,28.39 × 10<sup>3</sup>,1.165 × 10<sup>5</sup>,,D,
"<p>When using the terms ""accuracy"" and ""precision"" for measurements</p>","""precision"" implies less measurement error than ""accuracy""","""accuracy"" implies less measurement error than ""precision""","""precision"" measures the repeatability of a measurement",both terms mean the same thing,,C,

<p>The number 14.8 can also be expressed as</p>,1.48 × 10<sup>–1</sup>,1.48 × 10<sup>0</sup>,1.48 × 10<sup>1</sup>,1.48 × 10<sup>2</sup>,,C,
<p>The digits in a measured number that are known to be correct are called</p>,accuracy digits,significant digits,error digits,precision digits,,B,
<p>Which of the following is expressed in engineering notation?</p>,470 × 10<sup>5</sup>,82 × 10<sup>–2</sup>,9.1 × 10<sup>–6</sup>,14.7 × 10<sup>8</sup>,,C,
<p>The unit for frequency is the</p>,hertz,ampere,watt,second,,A,
"<p>Add 21 mA and 8000 <img align=""absmiddle"" alt=""mu.gif"" src=""/_files/images/basic-electronics/basics/mu.gif""/>A and express the result in milliamperes.</p>",21.8 mA,218 mA,29 mA,290 mA,,C,
<p>Dividing 24 × 10<sup>11</sup> by 3 × 10<sup>4</sup> equals</p>,8 × 10<sup>4</sup>,8 × 10<sup>7</sup>,8 × 10<sup>11</sup>,8 × 10<sup>15</sup>,,B,
<p>Pico is what relation to micro?</p>,one-tenth,one-hundredth,one-thousandth,one-millionth,,D,

question,A,B,C,D,E,answer,explanation
<p>One revolution of a conductor through the magnetic field of a basic generator will produce two complete sine waves.</p>,True,False,,,,B,
<p>A sine wave's peak-to-peak voltage value is always twice its peak voltage value.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
"<p>If a wave has frequency of 2 Hz, it has a period of ?</p>",1s,1/2 s,2.5s,2s,,B," <p>Period is usually 1/Frequency</p>

question,A,B,C,D,E,answer,explanation
<p>The shell that is closest to the nucleus of an atom can contain a maximum of two electrons.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
<p>One coulomb of charge passing a point in one second is one ampere of current.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
<p>The unit of measurement for conductance is the coulomb.</p>,True,False,,,,B," The siemens (symbol: S) is the SI derived unit of electric conductance and electric admittance. Conductance and admittance are the reciprocals of resistance and impedance respectively, hence one siemens is equal to the reciprocal of one ohm, and is sometimes referred to as the mho. "
<p>An electron is the smallest subatomic particle of negative charge that orbits the nucleus of the atom.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
<p>A multimeter measures only voltage.</p>,True,False,,,,B,
<p>In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries conventional current flow was routinely used.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
<p>Voltage is the driving force that establishes the flow of current.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
"<p>A resistor color coded with brown, black, and orange bands has a value of 10 k<img align=""absmiddle"" alt=""omega.gif"" src=""/_files/images/basic-electronics/basics/omega.gif""/>.</p>",True,False,,,,A,
<p>A conductor will not carry current.</p>,True,False,,,,B,
<p>The abundance of electrons would imply a negative charge.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
<p>The atomic number is the number of neutrons in the nucleus of an atom.</p>,True,False,,,,B,
<p>Charges of the same polarity tend to attract one another.</p>,True,False,,,,B,
<p>The atomic number of an atom equals the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus.</p>,True,False,,,,B," In chemistry and physics, the atomic number (also known as the proton number) is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom and therefore identical to the charge number of the nucleus. "
<p>A normally open push-button<i> </i>switch can carry current when not pushed.</p>,True,False,,,,B,
"<p>Switches are either on or off, but can have multiple poles.</p>",True,False,,,,A,
<p>The movement of electrons between two points is called voltage.</p>,True,False,,,,B,
<p>Electrons flow from negative to positive when a voltage is applied across a conductor.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
<p>The symbol that represents electrical charge is <i>Q</i>.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
<p>All conductors have some resistance.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
<p>Resistance is the pressure that causes current to flow.</p>,True,False,,,,B,
<p>The potential difference between two points is called voltage.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
<p>An open circuit allows current to flow.</p>,True,False,,,,B,
<p>Switches are used to open and close paths for current.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
<p>Carbon is a semiconductor.</p>,True,False,,,,A,

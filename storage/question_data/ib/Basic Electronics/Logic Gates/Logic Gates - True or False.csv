question,A,B,C,D,E,answer,explanation
<p>The output of an exclusive-OR (XOR) gate is 1 only when the inputs are different.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
"<p>If the output of a gate is OFF when the inputs are the same, and ON when they are different, the gate must be an exclusive-OR.</p>",True,False,,,,A,
<p>The output of a NAND gate is the same as the inverted output of an AND gate.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
<p>Logic gate circuits contain predictable gate functions that open their outputs.</p>,True,False,,,,B,
"<p>If both inputs are required to be ON for the output to be ON, the gate must be an AND gate.</p>",True,False,,,,A,
<p>A NAND gate consists of an AND gate and an OR gate connected in series with each other.</p>,True,False,,,,B,
<p>The exclusive-NOR (XNOR) gate is simply an OR gate followed by a NOT gate.</p>,True,False,,,,B,

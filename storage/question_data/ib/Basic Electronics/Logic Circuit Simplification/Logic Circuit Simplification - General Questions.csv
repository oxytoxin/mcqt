question,A,B,C,D,E,answer,explanation
<p>Which statement below best describes a Karnaugh map?</p>,It is simply a rearranged truth table.,The Karnaugh map eliminates the need for using NAND and NOR gates.,Variable complements can be eliminated by using Karnaugh maps.,A Karnaugh map can be used to replace Boolean rules.,,A,
<p>Which of the examples below expresses the commutative law of multiplication?</p>,A + B = B + A,A • B = B + A,A • (B • C) = (A • B) • C,A • B = B • A,,D,
"<p>The Boolean expression <img align=""absmiddle"" alt=""mcq19_1001_1.gif"" src=""/_files/images/basic-electronics/complete/mcq19_1001_1.gif""/> is logically equivalent to what single gate?</p>",NAND,NOR,AND,OR,,A,
<p>The observation that a bubbled input OR gate is interchangeable with a bubbled output AND gate is referred to as:</p>,a Karnaugh map,DeMorgan's second theorem,the commutative law of addition,the associative law of multiplication,,B,
<p>The systematic reduction of logic circuits is accomplished by:</p>,symbolic reduction,TTL logic,using Boolean algebra,using a truth table,,C,
"<p>Logically, the output of a NOR gate would have the same Boolean expression as a(n):</p>",NAND gate immediately followed by an INVERTER,OR gate immediately followed by an INVERTER,AND gate immediately followed by an INVERTER,NOR gate immediately followed by an INVERTER,,B,
<p>Which of the examples below expresses the distributive law of Boolean algebra?</p>,A • (B • C) = (A • B) + C,A + (B + C) = (A • B) + (A • C),A • (B + C) = (A • B) + (A • C),(A + B) + C = A + (B + C),,C,
<p>Which output expression might indicate a product-of-sums circuit construction?</p>,"<img align=""absmiddle"" alt=""mca19_1011a1.gif"" src=""/_files/images/basic-electronics/complete/mca19_1011a1.gif""/>","<img align=""absmiddle"" alt=""mca19_1011b1.gif"" src=""/_files/images/basic-electronics/complete/mca19_1011b1.gif""/>","<img align=""absmiddle"" alt=""mca19_1011c1.gif"" src=""/_files/images/basic-electronics/complete/mca19_1011c1.gif""/>","<img align=""absmiddle"" alt=""mca19_1011d1.gif"" src=""/_files/images/basic-electronics/complete/mca19_1011d1.gif""/>",,D,
"<p>One of  DeMorgan's theorems states that <img align=""absmiddle"" alt=""mcq19_1007_1.gif"" src=""/_files/images/basic-electronics/complete/mcq19_1007_1.gif""/>. Simply stated, this means that logically there is no difference between:</p>",a NAND gate and an AND gate with a bubbled output,a NOR gate and an AND gate with a bubbled output,a NOR gate and a NAND gate with a bubbled output,a NAND gate and an OR gate with a bubbled output,,B,
<p>The commutative law of addition and multiplication indicates that:</p>,the way we OR or AND two variables is unimportant because the result is the same,we can group variables in an AND or in an OR any way we want,an expression can be expanded by multiplying term by term just the same as in ordinary algebra,the factoring of Boolean expressions requires the multiplication of product terms that contain like variables,,A,
<p>Which of the following expressions is in the sum-of-products (SOP) form?</p>,Y = (A + B)(C + D),Y = AB(CD),"<img align=""absmiddle"" alt=""mca19_1010c1.gif"" src=""/_files/images/basic-electronics/complete/mca19_1010c1.gif""/>","<img align=""absmiddle"" alt=""mca19_1010d1.gif"" src=""/_files/images/basic-electronics/complete/mca19_1010d1.gif""/>",,C,

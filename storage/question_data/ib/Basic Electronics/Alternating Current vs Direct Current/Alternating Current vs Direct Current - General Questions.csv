"<p>If a voltmeter measures a sine wave as 500 mV, what would be its average value?</p>",159.0 mV,318.5 mV,353.5 mV,451.0 mV,,D," <p>Some AC Voltage Conversion: </p>
<br/>
<p>Peak to rms:     multiply peak by 0.707.</p>
<p>Peak to average: multiply peak by 0.637.</p>
<p>Rms to peak:     multiply rms  by 1.414.</p>
<p>Rms to average:  multiply rms  by 0.9.</p>
<p>Average to rms:  multiply avg  by 1.111.</p>
<p>Average to peak: multiply avg  by 1.567.</p>
<br/>
<p>Mostly voltmeter shows rms value. So, Vav = 0.9*Vrms </p>
<p> = 0.9*500.</p>

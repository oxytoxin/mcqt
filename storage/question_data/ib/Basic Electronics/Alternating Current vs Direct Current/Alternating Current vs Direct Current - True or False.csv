question,A,B,C,D,E,answer,explanation
"<p>DC current flows in one direction, while ac current rises from zero to a maximum, then falls to zero in one direction, then rises to a maximum, then falls to zero in the opposite direction.</p>",True,False,,,,A,
<p>A square and a rectangular waveform appear to have a step voltage transition.</p>,True,False,,,,A,
"<p>The duty cycle of a square wave with a pulse width of 3 <img align=""absmiddle"" alt=""mu.gif"" src=""/_files/images/basic-electronics/complete/mu.gif""/>s and a period of 9 <img align=""absmiddle"" alt=""mu.gif"" src=""/_files/images/basic-electronics/complete/mu.gif""/>s is 40%.</p>",True,False,,,,B,

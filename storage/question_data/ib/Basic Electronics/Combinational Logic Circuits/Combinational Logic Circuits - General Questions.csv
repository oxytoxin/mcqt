question,A,B,C,D,E,answer,explanation
<p>How many inputs are required for a 1-of-10 BCD decoder?</p>,4,8,10,1,,A,
<p>Most demultiplexers facilitate which of the following?</p>,decimal to hexadecimal,"single input, multiple outputs",ac to dc,odd parity to even parity,,B,
<p>One application of a digital multiplexer is to facilitate:</p>,code conversion,parity checking,parallel-to-serial data conversion,data generation,,C,
<p>Select one of the following statements that best describes the parity method of error detection:</p>,Parity checking is best suited for detecting single-bit errors in transmitted codes.,Parity checking is best suited for detecting double-bit errors that occur during the transmission of codes from one location to another.,Parity checking is not suitable for detecting single-bit errors in transmitted codes.,Parity checking is capable of detecting and correcting errors in transmitted codes.,,A,
<p>A multiplexed display:</p>,accepts data inputs from one line and passes this data to multiple<b> </b>output lines<b> </b>,uses one display to present two or more pieces of information,accepts data inputs from multiple lines and passes this data to multiple output lines,accepts data inputs from several lines and multiplexes this input data to four BCD lines,,B,
"<p>When two or more inputs are active simultaneously, the process is called:</p>","first-in, first-out processing",priority encoding,ripple blanking,priority decoding,,B,
"<p>Which type of decoder will select one of sixteen outputs, depending on the 4-bit binary input value?</p>",hexadecimal,dual octal outputs,binary-to-hexadecimal,hexadecimal-to-binary,,A,
<p>A magnitude comparator determines:</p>,"A <img align=""absmiddle"" alt=""notequalto.gif"" src=""/_files/images/basic-electronics/complete/notequalto.gif""/> B and if A <img align=""absmiddle"" alt=""alpha.gif"" src=""/_files/images/basic-electronics/complete/alpha.gif""/> B or A &gt;&gt; B","A <img align=""absmiddle"" alt=""almostequal.gif"" src=""/_files/images/basic-electronics/complete/almostequal.gif""/>  B and if A &gt; B or A &lt; b",A = B and if A &gt; B or A &lt; b,"A <img align=""absmiddle"" alt=""identicalto.gif"" src=""/_files/images/basic-electronics/complete/identicalto.gif""/> B and if A &lt; b or a &gt; B",,C,
<p>A circuit that responds to a specific set of signals to produce a related digital signal output is called a(n):</p>,BCD matrix,display driver,encoder,decoder,,C,
<p>Which digital system translates coded characters into a more intelligible form?</p>,encoder,display,counter,decoder,,D,
<p>A basic multiplexer principle can be demonstrated through the use of a:</p>,single-pole relay,DPDT switch,rotary switch,linear stepper,,C,
"<p>In a BCD-to-seven-segment converter, why must a code converter be utilized?</p>",No conversion is necessary.,to convert the 4-bit BCD into gray code,to convert the 4-bit BCD into 10-bit code,to convert the 4-bit BCD into 7-bit code,,D,

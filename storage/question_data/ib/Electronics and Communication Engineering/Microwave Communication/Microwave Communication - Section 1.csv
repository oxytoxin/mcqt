<p>The velocity factor of a transmission line depends on</p>,temperature,skin effect,relative permittivity of dielectric,none of the above,,C, <p>∈<i><sub>r</sub></i> of a dielectric changes with humidity.</p>

<p>In a klystron amplifier the input cavity is called</p>,buncher,catcher,Pierce gun,collector,,A," <p>A Klystron is a vacuum tube used for generation/amplification of microwaves. </p>
<p>An electron beam is produced by oxide coated indirectly heated cathode and is focussed and accelerated by focussing electrode. </p>
<p>This beam is transmitted through a glass tube. The input cavity where the beam enters the glass tube is called buncher. </p>
<p>As electrons move ahead they see an accelerating field for half cycle and retarding field for the other half cycle. </p>
<p>Therefore, some electrons are accelerated and some are retarded. This process is called velocity modulation. </p>
<p>The velocity modulation causes bunching of electrons. This bunching effect converts velocity modulation into density modulation of beam. </p>
<p>The input is fed at buncher cavity and output is taken at catcher cavity. </p>
<p>In a two cavity klystron only buncher and catcher cavity are used. In multi cavity klystron one or more intermediate cavities are also used. </p>

<p>The beam and wave travel along the structure at the same speed. </p>
<p>Thus interaction occurs between beam and wave and the beam delivers energy to the RF wave. </p>
<p>Therefore the signal gets strengthened and amplified output is delivered at the other end of tube. </p>
<p>The main features of TWT are :</p>
<p>1. Frequency range - 0.5 GHz to 90 GHz</p>
<p>2. Power output - 5 mW at low frequencies(less than 20 GHz) 250 kW (continuous wave) at 3 GHz 10 MW (pulsed) at 3 GHz</p>
<p>3. Efficiency - about 5 to 20%</p>
<p>4. Noise - about 5 dB for low power TWT 25 dB for high power TWT </p>
<p>TWT is used as RF amplifier in broadband microwave receivers, repeater amplifier in broad band communication systems, communication satellites etc.</p> "
<p>In a turnstile antenna two-half wave resonant wire radiators are placed at 90° to each other in the same plane and are excited</p>,in phase,in phase opposition,90° out of phase with each other,45° out of phase with each other,,C," <p>Since the two wire radiators are at 90° to each other, they have to be excited 90° out of phase with each other.</p> "

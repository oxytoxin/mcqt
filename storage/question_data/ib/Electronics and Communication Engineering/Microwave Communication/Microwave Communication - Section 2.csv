<p>The bunching action which occurs in multicavity klystron amplifier can be represented by Applegate diagram</p>,True,False,,,,A," <p>A Klystron is a vacuum tube used for generation/amplification of microwaves. </p>
<p>An electron beam is produced by oxide coated indirectly heated cathode and is focussed and accelerated by focussing electrode. </p>
<p>This beam is transmitted through a glass tube. The input cavity where the beam enters the glass tube is called buncher. </p>

<p>The velocity modulation causes bunching of electrons. This bunching effect converts velocity modulation into density modulation of beam. </p>
<p>The input is fed at buncher cavity and output is taken at catcher cavity. </p>
<p>In a two cavity klystron only buncher and catcher cavity are used. In multi cavity klystron one or more intermediate cavities are also used. </p>

<p>At high frequencies the rectification effect ceases and impedance of diode is effectively that of <i>i</i> layer. </p>
<p>This impedance varies with the applied bias. It is used in high frequency switching circuits, limiters, modulators etc.</p> "
"<p>In a vacuum tube, the transit time of electron between cathode and anode is important at</p>",low frequencies,high frequencies,both (a) and (b),frequencies which are neither very low nor very high,,B, <p>At high frequencies transit time is large as compared to the period of microwave signal.</p> 
"<p><p><b>Assertion (A):</b>  A line of length <img src=""/_files/images/electronics-and-communication-engineering/microwave-communication/25-340-1.png""/> and short circuited at far end has an input impedance of infinity.</p><p><b>Reason (R):</b> A line of length <img src=""/_files/images/electronics-and-communication-engineering/microwave-communication/25-340-1.png""/> and short circuited at far end behaves as a parallel resonant circuit.</p></p>",Both A and R are correct and R is correct explanation of A,Both A and R are correct but R is not correct explanation of A,A is correct but R is wrong,A is wrong but R is correct,,A, <p>A parallel tuned circuit has an infinite impedance if R is zero.</p>

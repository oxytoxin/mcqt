<p>Which device has internal positive feedback?</p>,Two cavity klystron amplifier,Multi-cavity klystron amplifier,Reflex klystron amplifier,All of the above,,C," <p>A Klystron is a vacuum tube used for generation/amplification of microwaves. </p>
<p>An electron beam is produced by oxide coated indirectly heated cathode and is focussed and accelerated by focussing electrode. </p>
<p>This beam is transmitted through a glass tube. The input cavity where the beam enters the glass tube is called buncher. </p>
<p>As electrons move ahead they see an accelerating field for half cycle and retarding field for the other half cycle. </p>
<p>Therefore, some electrons are accelerated and some are retarded. This process is called velocity modulation. </p>
<p>The velocity modulation causes bunching of electrons. This bunching effect converts velocity modulation into density modulation of beam. </p>
<p>The input is fed at buncher cavity and output is taken at catcher cavity. </p>
<p>In a two cavity klystron only buncher and catcher cavity are used. In multi cavity klystron one or more intermediate cavities are also used. </p>
<p>The features of a multicavity klystron are :</p>
<p>1. Frequency range - 0.25 GHz to 100 GHz</p>
<p>2. Power output - 10 kW to several hundred kW</p>
<p>3. Power gain - 60 dB (nominal value)</p>
<p>4. Efficiency - about 40%.</p>
<p>A multicavity klystron is used in UHF TV transmitters, Radar transmitter and satellite communication.</p> "

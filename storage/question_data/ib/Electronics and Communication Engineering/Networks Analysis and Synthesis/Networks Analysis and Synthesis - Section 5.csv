<p>A conductor has a cylindrical shape with a diameter <i>d</i>. Its resistance is 2 Ω. It is recast into a cylindrical conductor of diameter 0.3<i>d</i>. The resistance of new conductor is likely to be</p>,less than 2 Ω,less than 0.6 Ω,between 2 and 100 Ω,more than 100 Ω,,D," <p>Since new diameter is 0.3 <i>d</i>, the new area of cross-section a (0.3 <i>d</i>)<sup>2</sup>. </p>
<p>The volume remains the same. Therefore length increase by a factor <img src=""/_files/images/electronics-and-communication-engineering/networks-analysis-and-synthesis/158-34-1.png""/>. </p>

<p>In using KCL it is necessary that current leaving a node is written as negative.</p>,True,False,,,,B, <p>It may be written as positive or negative as per convenience.</p> 
"<p>A resistor is rated at 0.75 watt, 1 kΩ. Its current rating is</p>",1 mA,27.386 mA,1.268 mA,5.393 mA,,B, <p>0.75 = I<sup>2</sup> x 1 x 1000 or I = 27.386 mA.</p>

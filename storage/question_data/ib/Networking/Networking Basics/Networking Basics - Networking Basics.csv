<ol class=""networking-ol-123""><li>  VLAN Trunking Protocol
</li><li>  VLAN
</li><li>  802.1Q
</li><li>  ISL
</li></ol></p>",1 and 2,3 and 4,1 only,2 only,,B, VTP is not right because it has nothing to do with trunking except that it sends VLAN information across a trunk link. 802.1Q and ISL are used to configure trunking on a port.

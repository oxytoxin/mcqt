"<p>Why does the data communication industry use the layered OSI reference model?
<ol class=""networking-ol-123""><li>  It divides the network communication process into smaller and simpler components, thus aiding component development, design, and troubleshooting.
</li><li>  It enables equipment from different vendors to use the same electronic components, thus saving research and development funds.
</li><li>  It supports the evolution of multiple competing standards and thus provides business opportunities for equipment manufacturers.
</li><li>  It encourages industry standardization by defining what functions occur at each layer of the model.
</li></ol></p>",1 only,1 and 4,2 and 3,3 only,,B," <p>The main advantage of a layered model is that it can allow application developers to 
change aspects of a program in just one layer of the layer model's specifications.</p> <p>Advantages 
of using the OSI layered model include, but are not limited to, the following:</p> <p>It divides the 
network communication process into smaller and simpler components, thus aiding compo-
nent development, design, and troubleshooting;</p> <p>it allows multiple-vendor development 
through standardization of network components;</p> <p>it encourages industry standardization by 
defining what functions occur at each layer of the model;</p> <p>it allows various types of network 
hardware and software to communicate;</p> and it prevents changes in one layer from affecting 
other layers, so it does not hamper development. "
<p>A receiving host has failed to receive all of the segments that it should acknowledge. What can the host do to improve the reliability of this communication session?</p>,Send a different source port number.,Restart the virtual circuit.,Decrease the sequence number.,Decrease the window size.,,D," A receiving host can control the transmitter by using flow control (TCP uses Windowing by default). By decreasing the window size, the receiving host can slow down the transmitting host so the receiving host does not overflow its buffers. "
"<p>What are the decimal and hexadecimal equivalents for the binary number <i class=""networking-code"">10110111</i>?</p>","<i class=""networking-code"">69/0x2102</i>","<i class=""networking-code"">183/B7</i>","<i class=""networking-code"">173/A6</i>","<i class=""networking-code"">83/0xC5</i>",,B," You must be able to take a binary number and convert it into both decimal and hexadecimal. 
To convert to decimal, just add up the 1s using their values. The values that are turned on with 
the binary number of <i class=""networking-code"">10110111</i> are <i class=""networking-code"">128 + 32 + 16 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 183</i>. To get the hexadecimal 
equivalent, you need to break the eight binary digits into nibbles (4 bits), <i class=""networking-code"">1011</i> and <i class=""networking-code"">0111</i>. By add-
ing up these values, you get <i class=""networking-code"">11</i> and <i class=""networking-code"">7</i>. In hexadecimal, <i class=""networking-code"">11</i> is <i class=""networking-code"">B</i>, so the answer is <i class=""networking-code"">0xB7</i>. "
<p>What is the purpose of flow control?</p>,To ensure that data is retransmitted if an acknowledgment is not received.,To reassemble segments in the correct order at the destination device.,To provide a means for the receiver to govern the amount of data sent by the sender.,To regulate the size of each segment.,,C, Flow control allows the receiving device to control the transmitter so the receiving device's buffer does not overflow. 
"<p>Which three statements are true about the operation of a full-duplex Ethernet network?
<ol class=""networking-ol-123""><li>  There are no collisions in full-duplex mode.
</li><li>  A dedicated switch port is required for each full-duplex node.
</li><li>  Ethernet hub ports are preconfigured for full-duplex mode.
</li><li>  In a full-duplex environment, the host network card must check for the availability of the network media before transmitting.
</li><li>  The host network card and the switch port must be capable of operating in full-duplex mode.
</li></ol></p>","1, 2, and 5",2 and 4,"2, 3 and 4",5 only,,A," Full-duplex means you are using both wire pairs simultaneously to send and receive data. You must have a dedicated switch port for each node, which means you will not have collisions. Both the host network card and the switch port must be capable and set to work in full-duplex mode. "
"<p>Which of the following are types of flow control?
<ol class=""networking-ol-123""><li>  Buffering
</li><li>  Cut-through

"<p>What are two purposes for segmentation with a bridge?
<ol class=""networking-ol-123""><li>  To add more broadcast domains.
</li><li>  To create more collision domains.
</li><li>  To add more bandwidth for users.
</li><li>  To allow more broadcasts for users.
</li></ol></p>",1 only,2 and 3,2 and 4,4 only,,B," Bridges break up collision domains, which allow more bandwidth for users. "
"<p>How does a host on an Ethernet LAN know when to transmit after a collision has occurred?
<ol class=""networking-ol-123""><li>  In a CSMA/CD collision domain, multiple stations can successfully transmit data simultaneously.
</li><li>  In a CSMA/CD collision domain, stations must wait until the media is not in use before transmitting.
</li><li>  You can improve the CSMA/CD network by adding more hubs.
</li><li>  After a collision, the station that detected the collision has first priority to resend the lost data.
</li><li>  After a collision, all stations run a random backoff algorithm. When the backoff delay period has expired, all stations have equal priority to transmit data.
</li></ol></p>",1 and 3,2 and 4,"1,3 and 4",2 and 5,,D," Once transmitting stations on an Ethernet segment hear a collision, they send an extended jam signal to ensure that all stations recognize the collision. After the jamming is complete, each sender waits a predetermined amount of time, plus a random time. After both timers expire, they are free to transmit, but they must make sure the media is clear before transmitting and that they all have equal priority. "
"<p>Which of the following types of connections can use full duplex?
<ol class=""networking-ol-123""><li>  Hub to hub
</li><li>  Switch to switch
</li><li>  Host to host
</li><li>  Switch to hub
</li><li>  Switch to host
</li></ol></p>","1, 2 and 4",3 and 4,3 and 5,"2, 3 and 5",,D," Hubs cannot run full-duplex Ethernet. Full duplex must be used on a point-to-point connection between two devices capable of running full duplex. Switches and hosts can run full duplex between each other, but a hub can never run full duplex. "
"<p>Acknowledgments, sequencing, and flow control are characteristics of which OSI layer?</p>",Layer 2,Layer 3,Layer 4,Layer 7,,C," A reliable Transport layer connection uses acknowledgments to make sure all data is transmitted and received reliably.

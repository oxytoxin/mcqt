<p>You need to find the broadcast address used on a LAN on your router. What command will you type into the router from user mode to find the broadcast address?</p>,"<i class=""networking-code"">show running-config</i>","<i class=""networking-code"">show startup-config</i>","<i class=""networking-code"">show interfaces</i>","<i class=""networking-code"">show protocols</i>",,C," The command <i class=""networking-code"">show ip protocols</i> will actually show you the broadcast address for each interface - too bad it isn't a possible answer. Your best answer is <i class=""networking-code"">show interfaces</i>, which will provide the IP address and mask for each interface. "
<p>Which command will delete the contents of NVRAM on a router?</p>,"<i class=""networking-code"">delete NVRAM</i>","<i class=""networking-code"">delete startup-config</i>","<i class=""networking-code"">erase NVRAM</i>","<i class=""networking-code"">erase start</i>",,D," The <i class=""networking-code"">erase startup-config</i> command erases the contents of NVRAM and will put you in setup mode if the router is restarted. "

What command will you use?</p>,"<i class=""networking-code"">replace run start</i>","<i class=""networking-code"">copy run start</i>","<i class=""networking-code"">copy start run</i>","<i class=""networking-code"">reload</i>",,D," To completely replace the running-config with the startup-config, you must reload the router. Note : You may have picked option C, which isn't a bad answer. Remember, though, it doesn't replace the configuration, it appends it. "
"<p>If you delete the contents of NVRAM and reboot the router, what mode will you be in?</p>",Privileged mode,Global mode,Setup mode,NVRAM loaded mode,,C," If you delete the startup-config and reload the router, the router will automatically enter setup mode. You can also type <i class=""networking-code"">setup</i> from privileged mode at any time. "
"<p>What is the problem with an interface if you type <i class=""networking-code"">show interface serial 0</i> and receive the following message?
<i class=""networking-code"">""Serial0 is administratively down, line protocol is down.""</i></p>",The keepalives are different times.,The administrator has the interface shut down.,The administrator is pinging from the interface.,No cable is attached.,,B," If an interface is shut down, the <i class=""networking-code"">show interface</i> command will show the interface as administratively shut down. (It is possible that no cable is attached, but you can't tell that from this message.) "
